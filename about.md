I'm Niko, and I'm an independant freelance Software-Architect, Developer, and Trainer, mainly for Java and JavaScript enterprise solutions, integrations and web development.
My focus is on authentication and identity management and cloud computing, or cloud architectures.
I've been advising and supporting clients across industries, conduct workshops, trainings and architecture reviews - an will be continue doing it, of course.

I'm highly interested in Serverless architectures, not at least because I [wrote a book about Serverless Computing in AWS](http://serverlessbuch.de), and how to integrate serverless parts (and other managed services) in value-adding ways to your cloud, on-premise or hybrid infrastructure.
Using various technologies and programming languages.

When it comes to authentication, I usually use Keycloak Identity and Access Management from Red Hat.
I started in 2015 with my first Keycloak authentication project and I'm always happy when using it in one of my customers projects or to help customers to integrate it in their IT landscapes and environments.
I've also contributed work to Keycloak.
Helping to make the authentication process a bit safer, by doing things right.

_And doing things right is not always complicated.
Most of the times it's very simple. That's how life works - if it's not simple, it won't work and it won't last!_

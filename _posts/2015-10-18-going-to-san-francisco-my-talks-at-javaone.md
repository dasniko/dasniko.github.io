Only a few days to go - until my trip to San Francisco for this year's [JavaOne](https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html) conference!

I'm pretty excited to meet again old and new friends, attending good and inspiring sessions and hands-on labs and not at least [giving two talks by myself](https://events.rainfocus.com/oow15/catalog/oracle.jsp?event=javaone&search=niko%20k%C3%B6bler&search.event=javaoneEvent):

- **[Test Your Nashorn JavaScript with JUnit, Groovy Spock and Jasmine [CON2129]](https://events.rainfocus.com/oow15/catalog/oracle.jsp?event=javaone&search=CON2129&search.event=javaoneEvent)**  
_Monday, Oct 26, 11:00 a.m., Hilton - Golden Gate 4/5_

- **[Nodyn and Vert.x: Running Distributed Node.js Apps in JVM Environments [CON2133]](https://events.rainfocus.com/oow15/catalog/oracle.jsp?event=javaone&search=CON2133&search.event=javaoneEvent)**  
_Wednesday, Oct 28, 4:30 p.m., Hilton - Golden Gate 6/7/8_

I'm looking forward to a good time and hopefully to meet many of you in my talks and/or during the conference for some good conversations and perhaps some beer. If you have any comments on my talks and topics, just come over and don't hesitate to say _"Hi"!_ :-)

I don't rate anything, I'm just throwing a few things together:

- There's no more commercial support of Glassfish by Oracle (ok, that's no breaking news).
- There was [this rumor of lost interest](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2987529/java/insider-oracle-lost-interest-in-java.html) last year.
- Right before JavaOne 2015 Oracle dismissed a bunch of its Java evangelists.
- At JavaOne 2015 Oracle emphasized its engagement into Cloud strategy, no engagement in Java has been shown.
- Oracle's invest in JavaFX decreases (no more acitve development?).
- Rumors saying, that staff of Java EE departements are working now solely for WebLogic.
- Progress of Java EE 8 lacks, some projects seem to be on halt (see current copytext [at this ZEEF page](https://javaee8.zeef.com/arjan.tijms)).
- Now one of the lead Java EE evangelists, Reza Rahman, [has left Oracle](http://blog.rahmannet.net/2016/03/why-i-left-oracle.html).
- Oracle is still quiet, saying nothing to all these incidents.

Community is alive and brings innovation the the ecosystem.  
But is that enough?

[Adam Bien](http://www.adam-bien.com) has recently started a Slack channel with experts from the community to discuss how to keep Java development on track and push it even further.

**Comments, anyone?**

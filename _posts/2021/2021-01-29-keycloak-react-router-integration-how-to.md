Finally I managed to create a video series about my already several years existing demo application about how to setup a React.JS application and how to integrate with [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org) for successful authentication and probably some kind of role-based authorization.

This app is being maintained constantly and evolves over time.
Here's the link to the GitHub repository:

[![dasniko/keycloak-reactjs-demo - GitHub](https://gh-card.dev/repos/dasniko/keycloak-reactjs-demo.svg)](https://github.com/dasniko/keycloak-reactjs-demo)

The video series consists of three parts, available for free on YouTube:

1. Basic integration, configuration and usage with no 3rd-party library besides `keycloak-js` itself.
1. Conditional rendering of components and views, depending on Keycloak auth data, like authN state, roles, etc.
1. Integration with React Router, having conditional routes, depending on authN state, roles, etc.

Just leave me some üëç on the videos and subscribe to my YouTube channel at [https://www.youtube.com/c/NikoK√∂bler](https://www.youtube.com/c/NikoK√∂bler).

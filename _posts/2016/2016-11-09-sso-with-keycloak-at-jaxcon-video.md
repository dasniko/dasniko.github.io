Well, that escalated quickly! After my talk yesterday at W-JAX 2016 in Munich, we had a [discussion on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JAXenter/status/796049795358064640) on how fast after a talk the video recording should be available for the public. Other conferences are doing this in beetween 24 hours after the talk. The team of [JAXenter](http://jaxenter.de) accepted the challenge! And voila - my [SSO Keycloak](http://www.n-k.de/2016/11/sso-with-keycloak-at-jaxcon.html) talk is already available:

Kudos to JAXenter and especially Mr. Video Florian for working all night long! :-)

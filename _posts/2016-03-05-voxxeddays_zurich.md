A few days ago I was able to attend (and to give a talk at) the new _**[VoxxedDays](https://voxxeddays.com/zurich16)**_ conference in one of the most beautiful cites - _**Zürich**_ in Switzerland.

Kudos to the organizers, they did a very good job setting up this event. It took place in the Cinema Sihlcity, so there was enough space for everyone and there's even more space for more attendees. A great speaker line-up (Jonas Bonér gave the Keynote), good talks, stable wifi and enough possibilites for networking.

Yes, there's space to improve. But there's always space to improve. And I have no doubt that these guys will rock this conference next year into the next level!

Thank you again for having me!  
I'm really looking forward for next year's second edition of this great event!

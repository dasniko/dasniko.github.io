Sorry for not writing that much in the last weeks, I'm very busy currently with my customers project, some private projects and, not at least, with building our house...

But I did get in touch with an amazing amout of new technologies and architectures in the last weeks. Ok, perhaps not new at all, but new for me, as I didn't had the chance yet to play around with them. So I dealed a lot with dynamic languages, the Play! Framework and Micro Service architectures - this is fun!

Also I'm preparing new talks and writings for future conferences and platforms. I hope to come to a few international conferences this year again. Yet I can't guarantee, but I'm working on it! ;-)

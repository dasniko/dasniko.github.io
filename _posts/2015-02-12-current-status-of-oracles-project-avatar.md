In my [last blog post about the current status of Avatar](/2015/01/is-oracles-avatar-dead.html) (if you haven't read it yet, do it now), I complained once more about Oracle's communication strategy, or non-strategy. This time, I was loud enough! Oracle did hear me!

They sent me an email and asked for a phone call - which I accepted very gladly!<br />So, one week ago I talked to John Clingan (Principal Product Manager Java EE &amp; Glassfish Server) and Mike Lehmann (Vice President Product Management Application Server Infrastructure / Cloud Application Foundation) and asked for the current status and future plans of Project Avatar and Avatar.js.

Today, John finally published [this article about "Project Avatar Update"](https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/entry/project_avatar_update) in the Aquarium Blog, approximately the same statements, which I got in the phone call.

> **tl;dr:** _For now, the development of Avatar is on hold_

For me, this decision of Oracle is very disappointing and sad. I would've loved to hear/read, that the Avatar development will continue. I'm in doubt that the development will be restarted sometime.

Focussing on a native Node.js Oracle DB client and a Node.js process in the Oracle Cloud are noteworthy, but it's not approximately the same as running Node.js applications on the JVM, which focusses more on integration and re-usablity topics (application/library integration as also operations/monitoring).

Everyone, who's still interessted in running Node.js apps on the JVM, I can really recommend Nodyn from Red Hat. Also still in development, but in heavy development. I think (hope!), Nodyn will have better future than Avatar has/had...

I'd appreciate any comment on this topic, weather here or on twitter ([@dasniko](https://twitter.com/dasniko)). What do you think about Oracle's decision?

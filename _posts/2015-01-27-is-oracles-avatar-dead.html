After more than one year with <a href="https://avatar-js.java.net/" target="_blank">Avatar.js</a> and <a href="https://avatar.java.net/" target="_blank">Project Avatar</a> - the Node.js solutions running on the JVM from Oracle, I must assume, that <b>Avatar is dead!</b><br /><br /><i>Why?</i><br /><br />Let me summarize what happend in the past:<br /><ul><li>Oracle published Avatar as a bunch of various solutions, started from a pure frontend solution, a fullstack solution, competing with Java EE to a server-side only Node.js alternative.</li><li>A very promising sounding fullstack solution was released at JavaOne 2013, including source code, some examples and more-or-less well documented.</li><li>After six months (spring 2014), there were no more (public) commits in the repository and no more communication happened in the "Project Avatar"</li><li>Suddenly Oracle came up with "Avatar 2.0" at JavaOne 2014, and said, that the sources will be published "soon" (whatever that means).</li></ul><div>I did several talks and articles (<a href="http://blog.n-k.de/p/publikationen.html">online and print</a>) about Avatar in the past to promote this very interesting and promising solution. Perferct integration of modern non-blocking Node.js applications with the mature and stable Java ecosystem!<br /><br />And I asked a lot via Twitter, E-Mail, Mailing-List, etc. about the future of Avatar.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, it's just about 4 months after JavaOne 2014 and nothing happend at all! No answers to questions, no communication, no source code, no NOTHING!</div><div><br /></div><div>Because there are no answers at all, I now must suppose that <b>Avatar is dead!</b></div><div>I also posted this assumption to the Avatar mailing list:&nbsp;<a href="https://java.net/projects/avatar/lists/users/archive/2015-01/message/0" target="_blank">https://java.net/projects/avatar/lists/users/archive/2015-01/message/0</a>&nbsp;Perhaps I'm getting an answer this time!?</div><div><br /></div><div>In my opinion, Oracle made a big mistake in not talking to the community, to its customers! It's not about that the project isn't evolving any more. I'm disappointed about the missing communication!<br /><br />I would be very happy, if I'm wrong and there are news about Avatar. But I'm in doubt.<br /><br />Red Hat is doing it way better with <a href="http://nodyn.io/" target="_blank">Nodyn</a>. Just have a look at it when thinking about Node.js on the JVM!</div>

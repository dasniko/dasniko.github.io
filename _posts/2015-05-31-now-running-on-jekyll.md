Now, after about 3 or more years running my blog and website on Google's Blogger platform, I decided to do the switch to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

The transition was pretty easy, thanks to an importer for my old blog posts. Perhaps some of the links don't work properly, but these should be the minority. One trade-off I had to do, is to leave the existing comments in the blogger space, as they can't be imported, at least I don't know a way to do this. If you know, please let me know! The comments on my new site are powered by Disqus, a pretty well-known discussion/comments service to include into your own site.

If you like my new site, drop a line or two. If you don't like, keep it private ;-)

Last week the [Call for Proposals for JavaOne](https://www.oracle.com/javaone/call-for-proposals.html) conference opened. Be sure to submit your talks **latest on April, 29th!** After this date, your this years chance to be part of this great conference will be gone!

Together with other JVM language experts, I'm looking forward to as many as possible submissions from you! I'm honoured and pleased to be part of the review team of the JVM language track, which is lead by [Marcus Lagergren](https://twitter.com/lagergren).

CU in San Francisco!

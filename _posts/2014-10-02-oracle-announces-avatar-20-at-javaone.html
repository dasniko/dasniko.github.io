Just a short statement to satisfy my followers and readers:<br /><br /><b>Oracle has just officially announced "<i><a href="https://avatar.java.net/" target="_blank">Avatar 2.0</a></i>" at this years JavaOne conference.</b><br /><br />The brief major statements:<br /><ul><li>Avatar.js and Project Avatar become Avatar 2.0, no more naming issues</li><li>no need for a Java EE application server (like it was Glassfish &amp; WebLogic so far), Avatar 2.0 runs in its own JVM instance</li><li>run multiple (Node.js) event-loops parallel, each in a single thread within the JVM, but just one JVM process on OS layer</li><li>inter-thread-communication via event-bus or shard state, using a JCache implementation (currently Coherence)</li><li>Avatar Persistence: Model-Store-API to persist (JSON-)objects, even with relations to each other, like 1:1, 1:n, n:m, in a relational or non-relational database. For relational databases, Avatar Persistence makes use of JPA/Eclipselink (and therefore JDBC of course), user-transactions are possible</li><li>still work-in-progress is a WebLogic t3 thin client library to remotely invoke EJBs and to access JMS resources</li><li>UI client library is completely gone (what a luck!)</li><li>services (REST, SSE, WebSocket) are gone with the app server need (too bad) and have to be implemented with the use of own or third-party (npm) libraries</li><li>Avatar continues to be Open Source Software (GPLv2), new sources should be available soon (whatever "soon" means)</li></ul><div>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!</div><div>More to come soon...<br /><br /><b>Update:</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.n-k.de/2015/01/is-oracles-avatar-dead.html">http://blog.n-k.de/2015/01/is-oracles-avatar-dead.html</a></div>

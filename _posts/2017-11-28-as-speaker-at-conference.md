title: As a speaker at a conference...

Being a speaker at various conferences, I regularly attend talks of other speakers.
Not always it's fun to listen to them.
During the last months, I noticed more conspicuously some (bad) habits of (bad) speakers.
This led me to this short digest.

As a speaker at a conference, you not only should be an expert on the topic you're speaking about (and hopefully have some knowledge besides it) and be kind to the attendees of your talk/session.
You should (also):

- be well prepared, in terms of knowing your setup and slides
- be able to deal with failure (like _"everthing" fails all time_: laptops, presenters, beamers, microphones, light, live demos, etc.)
- have a plan b, in case anything of the above won't work, no matter what!
- accept other point of views, they're possibly legitimate, we speakers somewhat tend to have a very polarizing point of view in our topics
- don't bash against other technologies, approaches, languages, companies, see previous bullet
- instead talk about the pros of your solution/product/etc. and why you are excited about _(b/c it brings you lots of money is NOT a valid reason!)_
- don' t tell others about your huge company, if it's just a small one - it's easy to find out, because we all have internet
- don't "sell" things, people will very quick get behind this and won't trust you
- _...what else?... - write it to the comments!_

After more than one year with [Avatar.js](https://avatar-js.java.net) and [Project Avatar](https://avatar.java.net) - the Node.js solutions running on the JVM from Oracle, I must assume, that **Avatar is dead!**

_Why?_

Let me summarize what happend in the past:

* Oracle published Avatar as a bunch of various solutions, started from a pure frontend solution, a fullstack solution, competing with Java EE to a server-side only Node.js alternative.
* A very promising sounding fullstack solution was released at JavaOne 2013, including source code, some examples and more-or-less well documented.
* After six months (spring 2014), there were no more (public) commits in the repository and no more communication happened in the "Project Avatar"
* Suddenly Oracle came up with "Avatar 2.0" at JavaOne 2014, and said, that the sources will be published "soon" (whatever that means).

I did several talks and articles [online and print](/publications/) about Avatar in the past to promote this very interesting and promising solution. Perferct integration of modern non-blocking Node.js applications with the mature and stable Java ecosystem!

And I asked a lot via Twitter, E-Mail, Mailing-List, etc. about the future of Avatar.

Now, it's just about 4 months after JavaOne 2014 and nothing happend at all! No answers to questions, no communication, no source code, no NOTHING!

Because there are no answers at all, I now must suppose that **Avatar is dead!**  
[I also posted this assumption to the Avatar mailing list](https://java.net/projects/avatar/lists/users/archive/2015-01/message/0).
Perhaps I'm getting an answer this time!?

In my opinion, Oracle made a big mistake in not talking to the community, to its customers! It's not about that the project isn't evolving any more. I'm disappointed about the missing communication!

I would be very happy, if I'm wrong and there are news about Avatar. But I'm in doubt.

Red Hat is doing it way better with [Nodyn](http://nodyn.io). Just have a look at it when thinking about Node.js on the JVM!

I'm proud to announce, that I'll give again a full-day workshop at upcoming [JavaLand](http://www.javaland.eu) conference in March, 8th - 10th, 2016 at [Phantasialand](http://www.phantasialand.de) (Germany).

After my last (fully booked) workshop [JavaScript for Java Developers](http://www.javascript-training.net/training/js4j), in which I introduced JavaScript as programming language to Java developers, I'll now focus on using JavaScript in Java environments using the Nashorn Scripting Engine:

> **[Riding the Nashorn - Programming JavaScript on the JVM](http://www.javascript-training.net/training/nashorn)**

In this course I'll cover topics like:
- Usage of JavaScript on the JVM
- API- and Language extensions of Nashorn
- Nashorn and Maven and NPM
- Isomorphic JavaScript (with Java EE / Spring Boot and React.js)
- Nashorn on the CLI
- JavaFX with JavaScript
- Testing of Nashorn-Scripts (with JUnit, Spock and Jasmine)

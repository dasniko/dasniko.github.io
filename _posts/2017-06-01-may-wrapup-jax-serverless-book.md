Ok, this month I'm almost in time, just one day late! ;)  
May was packed with the **Jax conference** in Mainz, which I attended for three days and gave two talks and a cloud workshop.
And - of course - with new progress on writing the **Serverless Computing book**.

Let's start with the [Jax conference](https://jax.de).
I started my activites on the second day (at the first day I just attended some sessions and had great conversations) with my _Serverless hands-on lab._

Unfortunately the wi-fi connection was very bad this year, so we had some problems doing a cloud-workshop without any internet connection.
So I had to talk more than planned and showed more examples than doing them all together.
However, the participants who stayed until end of the workshop gave me good feedback and I enjoyed the lab!

In the afternoon I gave my session about _Serverless Computing_ which was also recorded.
Happily I didn't need to rely on wi-fi b/c there was a LAN cable available.

At the third day I gave my session about Security, SSO and IAM for web-based APIs.
It was scheduled in the main conference hall where approx. 800 ppl will fit in.
I was really astonished, that people still are that much interested in security topics (b/c that's not really somthing new, just new ways to do it).
Also afterwards I had many good discussions about SSO and IAM.
Seems that this topic will follow me quite a time. :)

This was also the first time that I know that an attendee made a sketch note of my talk.

I made good progress again on writing the [Serverless Buch](http://serverlessbuch.de)!
After April, where I had some trouble finding motivation and the right words, I'm now up again.

As it seems, I now have written something to any planned and un-planned chapter.
Yes, I decided to remove some initial planned chapters and to re-structure the content a bit, so that there now is a new chapter called "Deployment and Tools".

I have now nearly up to 300 pages (done with my own formatting, not the final layout settings, so this will change).
Original target was only a small book(let) between 120 and 150 pages.
I didn't expect me to write that much content. Wow!

In the next weeks I have to re-structure some paragraphs and other small things and integrate some of the first review comments I already got (thanks to [Eberhard Wolff](https://twitter.com/ewolff)).
But there has to be another review in a few weeks.
Also, artwork for some cover options is already in work. Let's see next month if I already have one chosen or if I need you to get the best of the available alternatives.

Still, keep following the [@serverlessbuch](https://twitter.com/serverlessbuch) Twitter account to be updated about progress and any news.
I also try to do a first shot of the [book website](http://serverlessbuch.de) in the next month!

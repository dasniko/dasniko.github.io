<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23IoT&amp;src=hash">#IoT</a> and me... Doesn't fit together, yet. Perhaps sometimes in the future... Too much coolnes, less maturity. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jaxcon&amp;src=hash">#jaxcon</a><br />— Niko Köbler (@dasniko) <a href="https://twitter.com/dasniko/statuses/466497754983055360">May 14, 2014</a></blockquote>I tweeted this during last JAX conference while listening to an introductory talk to IoT (Internet of Things). Since now I have no experience at all with IoT gadgets, I don't own a Raspberry Pi, no Arduino, no nothing. But at last, I'm curious. And I'm thinking about home automation for my new house...<br />As I'm addicted to JavaScript, I googled for a single-board computer, like Raspberry Pi, Arduino or Spark, but programmable natively in JavaScript. And I found: <a href="http://www.espruino.com/">Espruino</a>! Voila! Seems that this is a gadget I will test in the next weeks.

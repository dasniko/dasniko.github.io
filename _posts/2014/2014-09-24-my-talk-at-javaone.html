If you are at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html" target="_blank">JavaOne 2014</a> in San Francisco next week and want to know about server-side JavaScript programming in a full Java Enterprise environment, then you should join my talk:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?eventRef=javaone&amp;SESSION_ID=4091" target="_blank">Project Avatar - more than just Node.js on the JVM - Java EE written in JavaScript</a></li></ul>It's about accessing DB and JMS resources natively from JavaScript, all this asynchronously and non-blocking, like Node.js, but with multiple threads and being able to have an inter-thread-communication with an internal event bus. Additionally, node modules could be used, because the API is nearly 95% compatible with Node.js.<br /><br />If you're interested in these topics, please <a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?eventRef=javaone&amp;SESSION_ID=4091" target="_blank">visit my session</a>. I'm looking foward meeting you at JavaOne! Only a few days to go...

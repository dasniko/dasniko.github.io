[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org) Version 17 has just been released.
The default Keycloak distribution is now **Quarkus** based, so make sure to find your migration path accordingly and in-time!
From the [Keycloak Blog Post](https://www.keycloak.org/2022/02/keycloak-1700-released):

> **Quarkus distribution is now fully supported**
>
> The default Keycloak distribution is now based on Quarkus. The new distribution is faster, leaner, and a lot easier to configure!
>
> We appreciate migrating from the WildFly distribution is not going to be straightforward for everyone, since how you start and configure Keycloak has radically changed. **With that in mind we will continue to support the WildFly distribution until June 2022.**

The **Wildfly** distribution is now called **Keycloak Legacy**!

I'm planning to do several videos about the new Keycloak configuration and deployment options in future, hopefully soon.

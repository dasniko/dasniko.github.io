As of today, the [Serverless Buch](http://serverlessbuch.de) has just been released and is publicy available, e.g. at [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2eZS5UG), or your local book dealer.
So, go and get (grab) your copy!

I'm really looking forward to reviews from you, folks.

Thanks for all involved at my publisher [entwickler.press](http://entwickler-press.de) to make this happen.

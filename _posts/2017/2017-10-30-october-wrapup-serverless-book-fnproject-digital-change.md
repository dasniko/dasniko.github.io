October was quite mixed.
On the one hand, there was the public release of my serverless book.
But on the other hand, I had two common colds in a row and sometimes I still feel suffering from it. :mask:

As you [might have read](/2017/10/serverless-book-is-publicly-available.html), my book has been publicly released and is available at the (book)dealer of your trust (or via [this link](http://amzn.to/2eZS5UG)).
I got a lot of good feedback in the last weeks from readers and there's already a first :star::star::star::star::star: review at Amazon.
Great! Cool! Thanks a lot!

I don't know any sales numbers yet, but it feels like the book had a good start.
If you still don't have a copy - [_go and grab yours!_](http://amzn.to/2eZS5UG)

In my [last wrap-up](/2017/10/august-september-wrapup-serverless-book-oracle-java-ee-security-soteria.html) I wrote to have a look at the announcements Oracle did at JavaOne.
So, as you might have noticed, I couldn't resist to already rant about _Fn Project_ in [a separate post](/2017/10/fnproject-first-impressions.html), right after the announcement itself.
Some weeks later, I'm still not convinced, that this is a serverless approach.

Don't mix up containers and serverless!
It's two different approaches and both have their advantages and eligibilities when to choose and use which.

During the last weeks, I had some consulting workshops with customers about DevOps and Microservices.
All of them wanted to introduce DevOps and/or Microservices based on technological reasons.
I my opinion, this is completely wrong.
So I showed them another way of thinking, that theses topics (attitude! culture!) must be introduced _alone_ due to business and functional reasons.
Technology is just resulting.

I really don't like the term "Digital Transformation", most of the times I try to speak about (Digital) _Change_.
But, if you (and your business) want to survive this Change in our digital age, you have to change your business model to be more flexible, to be able to respond to changing and evolving business and market requirements.
These are evolving faster than ever.

DevOps and Microservices architectures can help you reaching these goals.
But again, it _must_ be driven from the business side, not for technological reasons.  
If you need help - ask me, I might be the right one to be able to help you coping with the change.

So long, stay tuned and if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask. As always, I’m happy to answer!

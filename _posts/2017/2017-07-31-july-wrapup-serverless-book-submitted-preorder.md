A very important milestone towards my first book is reached:
I submitted the whole manuscript to my publisher [entwickler.press](http://entwickler-press.de).
Additionally, you can already preorder the book at Amazon: [http://amzn.to/2eZS5UG](http://amzn.to/2eZS5UG)

In the last two months, I did a lot of review work on the already written content.
I don't know how many spelling errors I fixed, but there will still be a lot left (I guess).
Hopefully my editor will also find and fix some.

But what I know is, that I really decided to re-write the whole first chapter before I sent out copies to a bunch of reviewers.
In my [may wrap-up](/2017/06/may-wrapup-jax-serverless-book.html), I already wrote about restructuring some chapters and content, but now I also have re-written a whole bunch of pages.
In the end, this was a good decision, at least from my point of view.
In comparison to the first version, the current one is much better.

Also, I got very much, good and valuable feedback from my reviewers Eberhard Wolff ([@ewolff](https://twitter.com/ewolff)), Jörn Hameister ([@hameiste](https://twitter.com/hameiste)), Michael Simons ([@rotnroll666](https://twitter.com/rotnroll666) - he is currently writing the upcoming [Spring Boot Buch](http://springbootbuch.de/)), Frank Munz ([@frankmunz](https://twitter.com/frankmunz)) and Michael Buchholz (who hasn't a twitter account yet, but why?).
Thank you so much! This is really priceless!

As you can see here and on [serverlessbuch.de](http://serverlessbuch.de), the decision of the cover is already done.
I'm very happy with this version and like it very much.
It's _above the clouds_ and there are _no servers around ;-)_

In the current issue of [Java Magazin](https://jaxenter.de/magazine/java-magazin), there's also a full-page ad for the book.

Now I'm curious on what my editor makes out of my sources and how the book will look like with the final typesetting.
Yes, I know, there will be another round of review and fixing things, that I have to do in the next weeks...

However, I'm very surprised, that I've written that much (approx. 300 pages or more) within only 7 months.
I started writing in January, right after the decision to write the book and signing the contract.
My initial plan was to spend 6 months, but only write about 150 pages - only half of what I've written now.
I didn't know that I can write that much in this short period of time, and I missed the initial plan only by one month.
Of course, I had to give up many things since beginning of 2017 and I'm very thankful to my lovely wife Catharina who supported me that much to reach the goal.
Now I need some time to recover from writing and enjoying the other things in life again.

Nevertheless, I keep on giving talks on conferences (see right column "Meet mee at these events") and hope to meet a lot of you guys and girls on these (and other) events.
And I'm pretty sure, I will continue writing - at least articles, and perhaps, some time again, another book.

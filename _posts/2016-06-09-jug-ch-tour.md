I'm proud to announce my upcoming [JUG Switzerland](http://www.jug.ch) Tour in August/September 2016:

- **August, 30th, Zürich:** [No more stress with your tests, stresstests with Gatling!](/talks/#gatling)
- **August, 31st, Basel:** [Isomorphic JavaScript Webapps on the JVM with React.js and Java EE MVC](/talks/#isomorphic)
- **September, 2nd, Luzern:** [Isomorphic JavaScript Webapps on the JVM with React.js and Java EE MVC](/talks/#isomorphic)

_Details (locations, times) will be available on the [jug.ch](http://www.jug.ch) website!_

Currently I'm also looking to give a JavaScript/Nashorn Training in Zürich in co-operation with [42talents](http://42talents.com).
There's nothing confirmed yet, but we are working on it and I'll spread the word as soon it's available!
